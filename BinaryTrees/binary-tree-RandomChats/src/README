# BinaryTree README

## Overview

This program initializes a Binary Tree class and methods, and demonstrates
the methods used in the BinaryTreeDriver.java class

## Compiling and Using

Make sure you save the file into the correct file path, then use dir
and cd to find the file path and file location. Make sure the file
is compiled with javac, then after the java file is compiled,
just execute it to get the file to load properly. You can also run this
program through the Eclipse IDE.

## Discussion

If you remember how I said that I overcomplicated DoubleLinkedList, boy
did I do the exact same thing here :D (I may need to fix that oops). Yeah 
I for a long portion of this project just overcomplicated the code I was 
making and made things much harder for myself than they really should have 
been. I was incredibly stubborn with getting my code to work a certain way,
only to throw myself at the issue over and over again when it was the wrong
approach from the very beginning. Other than me making this project harder 
for myself, there's not much really to speak on for this project other than
the remove method was a very weird process to get fully working, but hey, I 
managed to get it working with a frick ton of help.

## Testing

I used the debugger to test this project, as well as checking for any
syntax errors or general mistakes I made through this debugger tool, as
well as going through the methods I was creating to make sure their functionality
was working as planned.
