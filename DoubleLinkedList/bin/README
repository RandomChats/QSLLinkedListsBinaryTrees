# DoubleLinkedList README

## Overview

This program preforms various tests on different arrays using built
in methods created by both me and those that were provided by the program. 

## Compiling and Using

Make sure you save the file into the correct file path, then use dir
and cd to find the file path and file location. Make sure the file
is compiled with javac, then after the java file is compiled,
just execute it to get the file to load properly. You can also run this
program through the Eclipse IDE.

## Discussion

Double Linked List... In the beginning, I felt very rushed because I was
already behind due to Single Linked List, so DLL felt very daunting for me. 
After importing all of my methods from SLL, I went to work tweaking them to fit
DLL, and went on to work with the ListIterator. Obviously I didn't do any tests
like a very smart coder, so I didn't realize how broken a lot of my main methods
were. After working on my ListIterator and getting it to a "functional" state, I
ran my tests, and saw many of my main methods were broken. After spending a while
fixing my main methods, I went to work on my Iterator methods so I could get my 
concurrency to work properly. After that, I added more tests, fixed the issues
that came up when I made them, and got my test number up to the 2000 that we needed
for the project.

## Testing

I used the debugger to test this project, as well as checking for any
syntax errors or general mistakes I made through this debugger tool, as
well as going through the methods I was creating to make sure their functionality
was working as planned.
